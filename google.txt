Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they

were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[17][18][19] The project initially

involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of

the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a

company;[20][21] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[22][23]

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on

the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[24] They called

this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[25][26] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[20]
